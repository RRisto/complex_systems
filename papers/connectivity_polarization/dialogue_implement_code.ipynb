    "Over the past two decades, the number of close social connections increased substantially, at least by a factor of two. At the same time, societal opinions have become increasingly polarized in many Western countries. To explore whether these trends could be connected, we employ a simple computational model of society, where people-within their social networks-continuously compare and update their opinions. Here, we show that the model that is known to realistically capture both homophily and social balance exhibits a phase transition phenomenon where, above a critical social connectivity, an explosive transition toward strong polarization must occur. The model allows us to understand the empirical inflation of polarization during the last decades as a function of the observed increased values of social connectivity. In the presence of a small fraction of synchronized influencers, the transition becomes continuous; however, polarization then appears at lower connectivities. We discuss the implications of the presence of a phase transition in **social polarization.**\n",

    "polarization | social networks | phase transitions | agent based model | social balance\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite unprecedented levels of social connectivity provided by new forms of communi-cation and social media, many Western societies appear to be more divided than ever. For example,in the United States, growing political polarization increasingly determines how individuals perceive themselves and others (1), and fuels hostility in public discourse (2), strains relationships (3), and influences workplace decisions (4). Political polarization carries well-documented costs such as eroding public trust, undermining democratic processes, and impairing collective problem-solving (5,6).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the existence and extent of polarization were debated over the last two decades ago (7,8), recently, evidence for an increase and even acceleration of polarization is building up (9-13). For example, the increasing ideological divergence in the US electorate, where Democraticvoters shift toward more liberal stances and Republicans toward more conservative ones (14), is visible in survey data of the Pew Research Institute (15); see Fig.1 A-C.Clearly, the ideological positions, $\\bar {s}_{i}$ i, of Democrats and Republicans are seen to diverge between 1999 and 2017. For the way of how ideological positions are quantified, see Materials and Methods. Based on the same Pew Research survey (15), the polarization, ψ, shown in Fig. 1D, clearly increases sharply fromn approximately 0.11before 2010 to 0.19 in 2017. For the definition of the measure of polarization, $Ψ$ ,see Materials and Methods and SI Appendix, section 1; for more information on the survrey, see SI Appendix, section 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the samne time period, social connectivity increased considerably. Fig. 1E shows the increase of connectivity as reported in a number of surveys conducted in various countries. HHere, importantly, social connectivity is defined as the average number of close friendships. The figure reveals a consistent pattern of increasing connectivity starting in 2009 in all the countries (colors), including Germany (17,18), the Netherlands (18,19), and Norway (18, 20). Shapes indicate the different surveys. For more details,see SI Appendix, section 3. The U.S. surveys (red), all using the identical survey questions, conducted in 2004, 2008, and 2020, are indicated by squares in Fig. 1E). All show a clear increase in close friendships (21, 22). The dashed line is a logistic regression to all data points and estimates the average degree of the close friendship network denoted as $\\left\\langle _{+}\\right\\rangle$ . An approximately 100% increase from approximnately 2.2 in 2004 to about 4.1 in 2024 is apparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This drastic inflation of connectivity in close social ties shortly after 2008 is most likely due to innovations in communication and social medHia. By 2008,both the iPhone and Android smartphones were launched, and the first version of Facebook was available to the general public [vertical line (I) in panel (E)]. The dramatic success of these new media is reflected in the fact that in 2010, Facebook already\n",

    "# Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "In an increasingly interconnected world, rising political polarization threatens social cohesion and democratic stability.Here,we demonstrate that the two trends might be fundamentally connected: Increasing social connectivity, often seen as a unifying force between people, can lead to polarization. Inspired by the physics of collective phenomena, we present a simple model that clarifies the underlying mechanisms. A polarization metric allows us to identify critical density thresholds at which social networks transition from diverse opinions to deeply divided societies. We show that empirically, polarization started to increase exactly with the advent of smartphones and social media. The results might help inspire strategies to mitigate the impact of polarization in digital and real-world communities.\n",

    "Since social connectivity and polarization both increase prac-tically at the same time, it is obvious to ask if both phenomena are related and, if so, how. Here, we address this question by employing a known social opinion dynamics model, where individuals adjust both their opinions and their social ties (23). The reason for this choice is that the model is not only coevolutionary in the sense that the quality of social ties (friendship or enmity) depends on the level of alignment of the individuals' opinions, but it also naturally incorporates two mechanisms that any model of opinion dynamics must include: social balance and homophily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homophily, the tendency to befriend like-minded people, plays an important role in opinion dynamics. It can go in both directions: People who are friends tend to align their opinions to become more similar, and people with similar opinions tend to increase the quality of their friendship. Homophily has been shown empirically in many different contexts, including schools (24,25),workplaces (26), and online communities (27-29), where similar individuals cluster. Once these friendships form, continued interaction typically strengthens their shared beliefs through social influence (30).\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of social balance is necessary to understand the possibility that increased connectivity can drive polarization.This might seem counterintuitive, as increased social connectivity would expose individuals to more diverse viewpoints, would create more mutual understanding and tolerance, and thus reduce polarization. However, there is empirical evidence against such simple conclusions. Exposure to opposing political ideas has been shown to often strengthen existing opinions rather than find common ground (31). Any framework trying to explain polarization must be able to capture such negative relations. Importantly,these negative relationships do not form by chance, but emerge in specific patterns. The way they are formed is the essence of the concept of social balance (32), the tendency of three-person groups (triads) to evolve into socially “comfortable”(balanced) configurations. In these balanced configurations, all involved feel a minimumn level of cognitive dissonance or social stress. In balanced triads, either all three relations are positive $(+++)$ , forming a cohesive friendship group (often with simnilar opinions), or two relations are negative and one is positive $(+--)$ , i.e., two friends both dislike a third person.Unbalanced triads create tension: either wwhen three people all dislike each other $(---)$ or when one person is friends with two others that dislike each other $(++-)$ . Countless empirical studies confirm that balanced triads are significantly overrepresented in social systems(33-38).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model introduced in ref. 23 combines the reinforcement of simnilar opinions through homophily and the formation of polarized and fragmented groups through social balance. Both of these components are essential in understanding how increased social connectivity influences polarization. Most earlier models of social opinion dynamics focused on only one of them. For example, voter models (39-42), that only assume positive interactions, usually guarantee consensus under many different conditions. Bounded confidence models (43, 44) that typically only consider homophily predict that low connectivity leads to polarization. More recent models that include more complex social mechanisms, such as antagonistic interactions (45-47) and social balance (23,48-50). Only recently, the possibility of how increased social connectivity can lead to polarization has been realized (49-52). Among these existing approaches, the model in ref. 23 fulfills the necessary requirements of homophily and social balance in a conceptually simple framework. Moreover, it was found to be compatible with real opinion formation processes in online group experiments (53).\n",

We call the average of $\\mathbf {s}_{i}$  the “ideology\" oof $i$  and denote it by $\\bar {s}_{i}$ i. Nodes are connected through a social network that indicates if two individuals know each other, $A_{ij}=1,$ ,or not, $A_{ij}=0.$ A link between two individuals has a quality,either positive (friendship) or negative (enmity). The network A is fixed, and the link quality $(+or-$  can change over time.

In each step, we randomly select one individual, $i$ , and flip one single, randomly chosen, opinion in its opinion vector. We then compute the change in cognitive dissonance, $\\Delta H^{(i)}$ : If stress decreases, we accept the flip;if stress increases, we accept the update with a certain probability that depends on a parameter, $\\beta$ , that controls the sensitivity of individuals to opinion differences. For details, see Materials and Methods. This dynamic ensures that the system can escape local stress minima and converge toward socially balanced configurations. If the flip is accepted and if, as a consequence, the sign of $_{ij}$ changes, the respective link quality between $i$  and $j$  is updated.\n",

    "The essence of the model is that every individual tends to min-imize their local cognitive dissonance by adapting their opinions such that agreement with friends (first term)and disagreement with enemies (second term) is reached. The parameter $α$  is used to weigh the relevance of the two terms. Typically, one would expect $1>α\\geq 05$ ,which means that it is more important to align with friends than to misalign with enemies.\n",

Community sizes now increasegradually with increasing connectivity. As the transition becomes more gradual, significant polarization occurs earlier at lower connectivities. Also, increasing the sensitivity to social stress, $\\beta$ ,leads to an earlier onset of the polarization transition at lower connectivities.

    "**Hysteresis** Effect.The model shows yet another important feature-a hysteresis effect. This means that once social connec-tivity $\\left\\langle k_{+}\\right\\rangle$ surpasses a critical degree and the network is polarized, the polarization is not immediately reversed by lowering $\\left\\langle k_{+}\\right\\rangle$ to just below the critical threshold. Instead, depolarization requires $\\left\\langle k_{+}\\right\\rangle$ to fall substantially below the threshold at which polarization initially occurred. We demonstrate this hysteresis in SI Appendix, section 6 and Fig. S3 $A$  and B. Notably, in the absence of radical influencers, polarization increases discontinuously with rising $\\left\\langle k_{+}\\right\\rangle$ ,but decreases continuously with falling $\\left\\langle k_{+}\\right\\rangle$ .However,when radical influencers are present, the hysteresis effect is less pronounced: Both polarization and depolarization occur continuously, with only minor differences in their behavior with respect to $\\left\\langle k_{+}\\right\\rangle$  (SI Appendix, section 6 and Fig.S3 C and $D$ ).\n",

    "# Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our results reveal a clear, connectivity-driven mechanism behind rising political polarization: Above a critical social connectivity, an initially cohesive society undergoes a sharp transition into a polarized state. The result is general in the sense that this transition occurs in societies that update opinions and friendship links based on the elementary mechanisms of homophily and social balance. The transition arises solely from the interplay of social balance and homophily. Homophily ensures that similar groups coalesce, while social balance repels opposing groups, resulting in increasingly widening opinion differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main contribution is that the model can be calibrated to survey data that capture the increase in connectivity in real-world social relations over the past two decades. This increased connectivity is related to technical innovations such as the invention of smartphones and the advent of social media,which both appeared around the same year, 2008. Both profoundly changed the way humans communicate immediately after their appearance. The calibrated model correctly predicts both the timing and the approximate extent of the polarization increase in the United States from 2000 to 2020, as quantified in a number of independent surveys, highlighting that rising social connectivity is, by itself, a strong enough mechanism to account for the rise in polarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding a small number of individuals with extreme opinions (influencers), we observe that the polarization transition becomes continuous. However, large levels of polarization are already reached at connectivities as low as 4.5, which is clearly within the regime of current connectivity levels in Western societies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model also contains another potentially relevant message. The polarization transition shows a hysteresis effect,meaning that once polarization occurs as a consequence of increasing connectivity, it can not simply be undone by reversing to previous connectivity levels. This means that once high polarization levels are reached, it becomes increasingly hard to bring them down with policies that would-if such a thing is even thinkable-target to reduce the number of close contacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Social network connectivity is not the only dIriver of polariza-tion in society. One important mechanism has been identified in the increase in political campaign spending. As demonstrated in ref. 58, the 2010 Supreme Court approval of Super PACs that eventually enabled a significant increase in campaign spending did increase polarization in the US legislative chambers. There, the focus was on the emergence of polarization within the US Congress itself. A recent study (59) discusses a similar relation between voter polarization and campaign spending in the context of US House elections. The main finding there is a rapid increase of voter polarization when the campaign spending of both parties exceeds a critical threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model presented in this paper is not realistic inseveral aspects, yet it is transparent and contains the most elementary elements in social opinion dynamics. Several parameters can be directly read off from data, such as the degree of social networks, and the value of $\\beta$  (53). Values for $α$ , $γ$  and $3$  must be estimated: The model dependence on these can be found in the sensitivity analysis summarized in SI Appendix, Fig. S3 and section 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is also unrealistic in the present version is to assume that every individual has the same sensitivity to cognitive dissonance, $\\beta$ . Future work making the model more realistic should include a degree of heterogeneity in $\\beta$  and $α$ , which would capture the variation in engagement and tolerance, respectively. Further, it would be desirable to include a more realistic mechanism of social network rewiring, where ties form or dissolve over time and better reflect the fluid nature of social networks. Most social media platforms, for instance, use link recommendation algorithms that inadvertently can further amplify polarization by increasing network clustering (60). However,for all of these improvements to add to the credibility of the model, it would be essential to obtain empirical data on the respective parameters and mechanisms. This we see as the current bottleneck.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we mention that in the presented model,there is no option to get rid of the polarization transition.What can be done is to shift the critical connectivity (the onset of the transition) in two ways. One is bychanging $\\beta$ . Lower $\\beta$  values shift the critical connectivity upward. A $\\beta$  of 2 means a critical polarization onset of a degree well above 5, which is above current connectivities. When $\\beta$  is interpreted as an individual's sensitivity to social stress, a reduction effectively means more \"tolerance\" toward opposing opinions. The way out of social polarization is either by reduicing social contacts (which seems unrealistic) or by increasing tolerance in the society-which might well be achieved by educational means. The other option for shifting the polarization transition is to reduce the disproportionate influence of a small radical minority. This could be achieved through stronger regulatory requirements for content moderation (61) and by disrupting know pathways for radicalization (62).As we have seen, this can increase the critical connectivity threshold and mitigate the onset of polarization. Similarly,building cross-cutting friendships (63)-possibly modeled as a few enforced \"bridge\" friendships between opposed clusters, or small, targeted network rewiring (64) could lead to a reduction in polarization. Research along these directions is necessary to arrive at the options to proactively counter the increasing levels of polarization.\n",

    "\n",
    "**14** A. **Minimum** **of the** **polarization** **measure.** We demonstrate that the minimum possible value of $ψ$  is zero, which occurs only 15 when all opinions are identical, given that N is sufficiently big. Since $ψ$  is proportional to the variance of $a_{ij}$ $ψ=0$ when all 16 $a_{ij}$  are identical. For a more dletailed analysis, we consider the two scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "17\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $a_{ij}=1$ for all $i,j:$ Everyone shares the same opinions.\n",
    "\n",
    "18\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $a_{ij}=a$  where $a\\neq 1$ :Every pair of nodes disagrees equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "19\n",
    "\n",
    "22\n",
    "\n",
    "To show that the second scenario is not feasible for most parameter values(N,G), we use the maximum number of unique 20 opinion vectors, $2^{G}$ , as an upper bound for the set of opinion vectors satisfying $a_{ij}=a.$  Despite this generous upper bound, if 21 $N>2^{G}$ ,at least two opinion vectors must be identical, resulting in an agreement value of one. All simulations discussed in this paper satisfy the condition $N>2^{G}$ and therefore only scenario 1 can occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "23 **B. Maximum of the polarization measure.** Since $a_{ij}$  is bounded from below by -1 and from above by 1, we can apply the 24 Bhatia-Davis inequality (1) for variances of X on the interval $[a,b]$ \n",

    "**C. Polarization for independent and identically distributed opinions.** To obtain a reference value for a \"random\" system,we 30 calculate the polarization in a system with independent and identically distributed opinions. Let $p$  be the probability that an 31 opinion (an element of the opinion vector) is1 and $(-$ the probability that an opinion is $-1$ . Therefore two opinions are 32 identical with probability $q=p^{2}+(-p^{2}$ and different from each other with probability $(1-q)=2p(1-p)$ .The number of 33 identical opinions between two vectors of size G then follows the binomial distribution $B(G,q)$ ,with variance $Gq(1-q)$ .Based 34 on this we can calculate the variance of $a_{ij}$  and finally $ψ$  As expected, $ψ$  is maximal for $p^{*}=1/2,$ resulting in $ψ^{*}=1/G$ .This value is shown as the dotted line in Fig. 1D in the main text.\n",

    "\n",
    "**D. Comparison between** $\\bar {s}_{i}$ **and** $a_{ij}$ .We use the relative number of matching opinions between two opinion vectors as the 37 foundation for the polarization measure, $ψ$ . Alternatively, one could compare the ideological positions $\\bar {s}_{i}$  for all $i$  in the 38 population,e.g. $φ=\\text {Avg}\\left(\\left|s_{i}-s_{j}\\right|\\right)$ . However,this approach is arguably less informative. For instance, consider the two 39 opinion vectors $\\mathbf {s}_{i}=(-1,1,-1)$ and $\\mathbf {}_{j}=(-1-11)$ . These vectors share the same ideological position, $\\bar {}_{i}=\\bar {}_{j}=-\\frac {1}{3}$ .As a result, $φ=0,$ even though the two individuals in this example are clearly ideological enemies.\n",
    "\n",
    "41 In contrast, the relative number of matching opinions between two opinion vectors better captures the polarization in the 42 system. For this example,since $a_{ij}=-\\frac {1}{3}$ ,a population evenly split between the opinion vectors $\\mathbf {S}_{i}$  and $\\mathbf {S}_{j}$  would show a 43 non-zero polarization of $ψ=\\frac {1}{36}$ \n",

If a question allowed multiple 50 levels of agreement (e.g.,“strongly agree\" and “not strongly agree\"), we treated both responses as agreement for analytical 51 consistency. If a pparticipant refused to answer, their response was recorded as 0. To standardize responses, we encoded agreement with the liberal position as $-1$  in the opinion vector and agreement with the conservative position as $+1$ .\n",

However, since our analysis focuses only on ties strong enough to influence opinions or reinforce 56 social identity when opinions align, we restrict our scope to close friendships, core discussion networks, and strong ties. These 57 relationships represent an individual's innermost social circle, characterized by frequent interaction and emotional significance. 58 In contrast, broader networks-including acquaintances and weak ties-may facilitate information diffusion but are unlikely to 59 exert the same persuasive influence. By limiting our analysis to the most influential social connections, we ensure that our estimates are directly relevant to the mechanisms under investigation.\n",

    "Over the past two decades, the number of close social connections increased substantially, at least by a factor of two. At the same time, societal opinions have become increasingly polarized in many Western countries. To explore whether these trends could be connected, we employ a simple computational model of society, where people-within their social networks-continuously compare and update their opinions. Here, we show that the model that is known to realistically capture both homophily and social balance exhibits a phase transition phenomenon where, above a critical social connectivity, an explosive transition toward strong polarization must occur. The model allows us to understand the empirical inflation of polarization during the last decades as a function of the observed increased values of social connectivity. In the presence of a small fraction of synchronized influencers, the transition becomes continuous; however, polarization then appears at lower connectivities. We discuss the implications of the presence of a phase transition in **social polarization.**\n",
    "\n",
    "polarization | social networks | phase transitions | agent based model | social balance\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite unprecedented levels of social connectivity provided by new forms of communi-cation and social media, many Western societies appear to be more divided than ever. For example,in the United States, growing political polarization increasingly determines how individuals perceive themselves and others (1), and fuels hostility in public discourse (2), strains relationships (3), and influences workplace decisions (4). Political polarization carries well-documented costs such as eroding public trust, undermining democratic processes, and impairing collective problem-solving (5,6).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the existence and extent of polarization were debated over the last two decades ago (7,8), recently, evidence for an increase and even acceleration of polarization is building up (9-13). For example, the increasing ideological divergence in the US electorate, where Democraticvoters shift toward more liberal stances and Republicans toward more conservative ones (14), is visible in survey data of the Pew Research Institute (15); see Fig.1 A-C.Clearly, the ideological positions, $\\bar {s}_{i}$ i, of Democrats and Republicans are seen to diverge between 1999 and 2017. For the way of how ideological positions are quantified, see Materials and Methods. Based on the same Pew Research survey (15), the polarization, ψ, shown in Fig. 1D, clearly increases sharply fromn approximately 0.11before 2010 to 0.19 in 2017. For the definition of the measure of polarization, $Ψ$ ,see Materials and Methods and SI Appendix, section 1; for more information on the survrey, see SI Appendix, section 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the samne time period, social connectivity increased considerably. Fig. 1E shows the increase of connectivity as reported in a number of surveys conducted in various countries. HHere, importantly, social connectivity is defined as the average number of close friendships. The figure reveals a consistent pattern of increasing connectivity starting in 2009 in all the countries (colors), including Germany (17,18), the Netherlands (18,19), and Norway (18, 20). Shapes indicate the different surveys. For more details,see SI Appendix, section 3. The U.S. surveys (red), all using the identical survey questions, conducted in 2004, 2008, and 2020, are indicated by squares in Fig. 1E). All show a clear increase in close friendships (21, 22). The dashed line is a logistic regression to all data points and estimates the average degree of the close friendship network denoted as $\\left\\langle _{+}\\right\\rangle$ . An approximately 100% increase from approximnately 2.2 in 2004 to about 4.1 in 2024 is apparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This drastic inflation of connectivity in close social ties shortly after 2008 is most likely due to innovations in communication and social medHia. By 2008,both the iPhone and Android smartphones were launched, and the first version of Facebook was available to the general public [vertical line (I) in panel (E)]. The dramatic success of these new media is reflected in the fact that in 2010, Facebook already\n",

    "# Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "In an increasingly interconnected world, rising political polarization threatens social cohesion and democratic stability.Here,we demonstrate that the two trends might be fundamentally connected: Increasing social connectivity, often seen as a unifying force between people, can lead to polarization. Inspired by the physics of collective phenomena, we present a simple model that clarifies the underlying mechanisms. A polarization metric allows us to identify critical density thresholds at which social networks transition from diverse opinions to deeply divided societies. We show that empirically, polarization started to increase exactly with the advent of smartphones and social media. The results might help inspire strategies to mitigate the impact of polarization in digital and real-world communities.\n",

    "Since social connectivity and polarization both increase prac-tically at the same time, it is obvious to ask if both phenomena are related and, if so, how. Here, we address this question by employing a known social opinion dynamics model, where individuals adjust both their opinions and their social ties (23). The reason for this choice is that the model is not only coevolutionary in the sense that the quality of social ties (friendship or enmity) depends on the level of alignment of the individuals' opinions, but it also naturally incorporates two mechanisms that any model of opinion dynamics must include: social balance and homophily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homophily, the tendency to befriend like-minded people, plays an important role in opinion dynamics. It can go in both directions: People who are friends tend to align their opinions to become more similar, and people with similar opinions tend to increase the quality of their friendship. Homophily has been shown empirically in many different contexts, including schools (24,25),workplaces (26), and online communities (27-29), where similar individuals cluster. Once these friendships form, continued interaction typically strengthens their shared beliefs through social influence (30).\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of social balance is necessary to understand the possibility that increased connectivity can drive polarization.This might seem counterintuitive, as increased social connectivity would expose individuals to more diverse viewpoints, would create more mutual understanding and tolerance, and thus reduce polarization. However, there is empirical evidence against such simple conclusions. Exposure to opposing political ideas has been shown to often strengthen existing opinions rather than find common ground (31). Any framework trying to explain polarization must be able to capture such negative relations. Importantly,these negative relationships do not form by chance, but emerge in specific patterns. The way they are formed is the essence of the concept of social balance (32), the tendency of three-person groups (triads) to evolve into socially “comfortable”(balanced) configurations. In these balanced configurations, all involved feel a minimumn level of cognitive dissonance or social stress. In balanced triads, either all three relations are positive $(+++)$ , forming a cohesive friendship group (often with simnilar opinions), or two relations are negative and one is positive $(+--)$ , i.e., two friends both dislike a third person.Unbalanced triads create tension: either wwhen three people all dislike each other $(---)$ or when one person is friends with two others that dislike each other $(++-)$ . Countless empirical studies confirm that balanced triads are significantly overrepresented in social systems(33-38).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model introduced in ref. 23 combines the reinforcement of simnilar opinions through homophily and the formation of polarized and fragmented groups through social balance. Both of these components are essential in understanding how increased social connectivity influences polarization. Most earlier models of social opinion dynamics focused on only one of them. For example, voter models (39-42), that only assume positive interactions, usually guarantee consensus under many different conditions. Bounded confidence models (43, 44) that typically only consider homophily predict that low connectivity leads to polarization. More recent models that include more complex social mechanisms, such as antagonistic interactions (45-47) and social balance (23,48-50). Only recently, the possibility of how increased social connectivity can lead to polarization has been realized (49-52). Among these existing approaches, the model in ref. 23 fulfills the necessary requirements of homophily and social balance in a conceptually simple framework. Moreover, it was found to be compatible with real opinion formation processes in online group experiments (53).\n",

    "At the critical degree, many small clusters (each consisting of ≤2% of nodes) merge into two opposing groups, each composed of roughly 50% of the population. Below the critical degree,small clusters maintain opinion cohesion while remaining randomly distributed throughout the system, resulting in low overall polarization; see neutral ideologies, $\\bar {s}_{i}$ i, in the Left Inset.

    "The orange squares in Fig. 4A represent the presence of a fraction of 2% influencers, which change the polarization transition into a continuous one.

Community sizes now increasegradually with increasing connectivity. As the transition becomes more gradual, significant polarization occurs earlier at lower connectivities. Also, increasing the sensitivity to social stress, $\\beta$ ,leads to an earlier onset of the polarization transition at lower connectivities.

    "**Hysteresis** Effect.The model shows yet another important feature-a hysteresis effect. This means that once social connec-tivity $\\left\\langle k_{+}\\right\\rangle$ surpasses a critical degree and the network is polarized, the polarization is not immediately reversed by lowering $\\left\\langle k_{+}\\right\\rangle$ to just below the critical threshold. Instead, depolarization requires $\\left\\langle k_{+}\\right\\rangle$ to fall substantially below the threshold at which polarization initially occurred. We demonstrate this hysteresis in SI Appendix, section 6 and Fig. S3 $A$  and B. Notably, in the absence of radical influencers, polarization increases discontinuously with rising $\\left\\langle k_{+}\\right\\rangle$ ,but decreases continuously with falling $\\left\\langle k_{+}\\right\\rangle$ .However,when radical influencers are present, the hysteresis effect is less pronounced: Both polarization and depolarization occur continuously, with only minor differences in their behavior with respect to $\\left\\langle k_{+}\\right\\rangle$  (SI Appendix, section 6 and Fig.S3 C and $D$ ).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our results reveal a clear, connectivity-driven mechanism behind rising political polarization: Above a critical social connectivity, an initially cohesive society undergoes a sharp transition into a polarized state. The result is general in the sense that this transition occurs in societies that update opinions and friendship links based on the elementary mechanisms of homophily and social balance. The transition arises solely from the interplay of social balance and homophily. Homophily ensures that similar groups coalesce, while social balance repels opposing groups, resulting in increasingly widening opinion differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main contribution is that the model can be calibrated to survey data that capture the increase in connectivity in real-world social relations over the past two decades. This increased connectivity is related to technical innovations such as the invention of smartphones and the advent of social media,which both appeared around the same year, 2008. Both profoundly changed the way humans communicate immediately after their appearance. The calibrated model correctly predicts both the timing and the approximate extent of the polarization increase in the United States from 2000 to 2020, as quantified in a number of independent surveys, highlighting that rising social connectivity is, by itself, a strong enough mechanism to account for the rise in polarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding a small number of individuals with extreme opinions (influencers), we observe that the polarization transition becomes continuous. However, large levels of polarization are already reached at connectivities as low as 4.5, which is clearly within the regime of current connectivity levels in Western societies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model also contains another potentially relevant message. The polarization transition shows a hysteresis effect,meaning that once polarization occurs as a consequence of increasing connectivity, it can not simply be undone by reversing to previous connectivity levels. This means that once high polarization levels are reached, it becomes increasingly hard to bring them down with policies that would-if such a thing is even thinkable-target to reduce the number of close contacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Social network connectivity is not the only dIriver of polariza-tion in society. One important mechanism has been identified in the increase in political campaign spending. As demonstrated in ref. 58, the 2010 Supreme Court approval of Super PACs that eventually enabled a significant increase in campaign spending did increase polarization in the US legislative chambers. There, the focus was on the emergence of polarization within the US Congress itself. A recent study (59) discusses a similar relation between voter polarization and campaign spending in the context of US House elections. The main finding there is a rapid increase of voter polarization when the campaign spending of both parties exceeds a critical threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model presented in this paper is not realistic inseveral aspects, yet it is transparent and contains the most elementary elements in social opinion dynamics. Several parameters can be directly read off from data, such as the degree of social networks, and the value of $\\beta$  (53). Values for $α$ , $γ$  and $3$  must be estimated: The model dependence on these can be found in the sensitivity analysis summarized in SI Appendix, Fig. S3 and section 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is also unrealistic in the present version is to assume that every individual has the same sensitivity to cognitive dissonance, $\\beta$ . Future work making the model more realistic should include a degree of heterogeneity in $\\beta$  and $α$ , which would capture the variation in engagement and tolerance, respectively. Further, it would be desirable to include a more realistic mechanism of social network rewiring, where ties form or dissolve over time and better reflect the fluid nature of social networks. Most social media platforms, for instance, use link recommendation algorithms that inadvertently can further amplify polarization by increasing network clustering (60). However,for all of these improvements to add to the credibility of the model, it would be essential to obtain empirical data on the respective parameters and mechanisms. This we see as the current bottleneck.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we mention that in the presented model,there is no option to get rid of the polarization transition.What can be done is to shift the critical connectivity (the onset of the transition) in two ways. One is bychanging $\\beta$ . Lower $\\beta$  values shift the critical connectivity upward. A $\\beta$  of 2 means a critical polarization onset of a degree well above 5, which is above current connectivities. When $\\beta$  is interpreted as an individual's sensitivity to social stress, a reduction effectively means more \"tolerance\" toward opposing opinions. The way out of social polarization is either by reduicing social contacts (which seems unrealistic) or by increasing tolerance in the society-which might well be achieved by educational means. The other option for shifting the polarization transition is to reduce the disproportionate influence of a small radical minority. This could be achieved through stronger regulatory requirements for content moderation (61) and by disrupting know pathways for radicalization (62).As we have seen, this can increase the critical connectivity threshold and mitigate the onset of polarization. Similarly,building cross-cutting friendships (63)-possibly modeled as a few enforced \"bridge\" friendships between opposed clusters, or small, targeted network rewiring (64) could lead to a reduction in polarization. Research along these directions is necessary to arrive at the options to proactively counter the increasing levels of polarization.\n",

The** ideological posi-tion of an individual,i,can be surveyed by collecting a number of her opinions into \"opinion vectors,\" in a collection of G different political opinions of individual i. For every individual, their opinions were collected in an opinion vector, $S_{i}$ j. Every component, $_{i}^{(k)}$ ,reflects a political stance on a particular topic, $k_{1}$ , as assessed in ref. 15; see SI Appendix, section 2. Opinions on individual stances are binary, in a way that 1 means conservative and-1 liberal. The average over all individual stances and positions, $\\bar {s}_{j}$ , defines the \"ideology\" of the individual. It can be put on an axis from conservative (Right) to liberal (Left). Fig. 1 A-C shows the histogram for the individuals participating in the study; typically,for every different survey, the number of participants varied between 985 and 10,013 individuals; see SI Appendix, section 2.The colors denotethe self-reported political affiliation of the individuals, with red representing Republicans and those leaning Republican, and blue representing Democrats and those leaning Democrat.\n",

    "To construct a Poissonian small-world network, N nodes are placed on a ring,initially without edges. Every node is assigned a target degree based on a Poisson distribution with mean $λ,$  corresponding to the desired average degree of the network &lt;k&gt;. Edges are then added, with nodes preferentially connecting to their nearest neighbors, until the assigned degree of every node is matched.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the initiaI edge assignment, we rewire the network according to the small-world algorithm (66), with a rewiring probability, $3$ . For small $ε_{1}$ ,this introduces shortcuts, while preserving the network's overall structure. We exclude networks that contain isolated nodes. Once the simulation of opinion dynamics reaches a steady state, we measure the average degree $\\left\\langle k_{+}\\right\\rangle$ of the network consisting only of friendly connections.

    "- Fixed polarization calculation (sampling pairs, not variance of alignment matrix)\r\n",
    "- Corrected Monte Carlo sweep (N×G flips per timestep, not 1)\r\n",
    "- Used 1000-10000 samples for polarization measurement\r\n",
    "- Matched all Julia implementation details\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Optimization\r\n",
    "Created heavily optimized version with:\r\n",
    "- Pre-computed neighbor arrays (avoid NetworkX lookups)\r\n",

    "\n",
    "Great! Let's walk through the code step by step. I'll start with the core concepts and we can dive deeper into any part you're interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## High-Level Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The code implements a **social polarization model** where:\n",
    "- People have opinions on multiple topics (binary: agree/disagree)\n",
    "- People are connected in a social network\n",
    "- They update their opinions to reduce \"social stress\" (disagreeing with friends or agreeing with enemies)\n",
    "- This can lead to society-wide polarization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: The Network Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The model starts by creating a **Poissonian small-world network**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def _init_network(self):\n",
    "    desired_degrees = np.random.poisson(self.lambda_avg, self.N)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- `N` people (nodes)\n",
    "- Each person gets a random number of connections from a Poisson distribution\n",
    "- Then adds \"shortcuts\" to make it a small-world (most people nearby, some long-distance connections)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question for you:** Do you want me to explain how the network construction works in detail, or should we move on to how opinions are represented?"

    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Opinion Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Each person has an **opinion vector** - their views on G different topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "self.opinions = np.where(\n",
    "    np.random.rand(self.G, self.N) < self.eta, -1.0, 1.0\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a matrix where:\n",
    "- **Rows** = topics (G topics total)\n",
    "- **Columns** = people (N people total)\n",
    "- **Values** = -1 (disagree) or +1 (agree)\n",
    "\n",
    "So `opinions[:, person_i]` gives you person i's views on all topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Relationships (Friends vs Enemies)\n",
    "\n",
    "People are friends or enemies based on how much they agree:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dot_product = np.dot(self.opinions[:, node], self.opinions[:, neighbor])\n",
    "rel = 1 if dot_product > 0 else -1  # 1=friend, -1=enemy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If two people agree on most topics → positive dot product → friends (+1)\n",
    "If they disagree on most topics → negative dot product → enemies (-1)\n",
    "\n",

    "3. Take the variance of all these fractions\n",

    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Pair 1: match on 7/9 topics → 0.78\n",

    "**Key validity concerns:**\n",

    "[*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10086127/ \"Understanding the associations between the number of close friends and life satisfaction: Considering age differences - PMC\") [*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10086127/ \"Understanding the associations between the number of close friends and life satisfaction: Considering age differences - PMC\") Young people may exaggerate their self-reported number of close friends and older adults may underestimate theirs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measurement issues:**\n",
    "- [*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10086127/ \"Understanding the associations between the number of close friends and life satisfaction: Considering age differences - PMC\") The question \"How many close friends do you have?\" is considered a valid measure that has been used in many studies, but the definition of \"close friend\" remains subjective\n",
    "\n",
    "**The loneliness paradox you mentioned:**\n",
    "- [*](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/11/friendships-less-is-now-more/ \"People have fewer close friends than in the 1990s. Why? | World Economic Forum\") People in the US have far fewer close friends than 30 years ago - just 13% say they have 10 or more close friends, compared with 33% in 1990\n",
    "- [*](https://www.statista.com/chart/28560/number-of-close-friends/ \"Chart: Friendships: Less is Now More | Statista\") The share of people saying they have no close friends went from 3% in 1990 to 12% in 2021\n",

    "So the data actually shows **declining** friendships, not increasing! This directly contradicts the paper's claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For your blog post:** This is a major issue - the paper claims connectivity increased, but other surveys show friendship numbers *decreased*. What do you think about this discrepancy?"

    "Exactly! That's a really important insight.\n",

    "- Loneliness going up (those connections don't satisfy deep social needs)\n",

    "Yes! That's the key insight of the model - and why it's counterintuitive.\n",

    "**The mechanism:**\n",
    "- More real friends → more opportunities to align opinions with them\n",

Selle efekti toob kaasa tõsiasi, et mida rohkem sõpru, seda sarnasemaks kipume oma arvamusi nende arvamustega muutma ning mida rohkem on vaenlasi, seda rohkem tahame neile vastanduda. Vaenlase all selles kirjatükis peetakse silmas teistsuguste poliitiliste vaadetega inimest, kellest tahame eristuda.\r\n",

Alumine joonis: sõprade arv eri riikides eri küsitluste põhjal (allikas)Autorid täheldavad, et polariseerumise kasv läheb kokku sotsiaalmeedia laiema tõusuga. Sotsiaalmeedias on lihtne luua seoseid sarnaste vaadetega inimestega, algoritm söödab neid ise ette. Samuti on seal lihtne demoniseerida teistsuguse arvamusega inimesi. Need platvormid pole disainitud sügavaks aruteluks vaid püüavad sinu tähelepanu pealt maksimaalset kasumit teenida.\r\n",

Tasemel 0.6 on polariseerumine palju tugevam. Täpne skaala polegi väga oluline, pigem on seda seos suhete arvu ja polariseerumise vahel.\r\n",
    "Sõprade puhul hakkab polariseerumisel rolli mängima tõsisasi, et mida rohkem neid on, seda suurem on surve muutuda nende sarnaseks (ning seda rohkem sõpru otsitakse sarnaste seast). Inimesed on sotsiaalsed olendid.\r\n",
    "Simulatsioon annab ka vihjeid, mida teha polariseerumise vähendamiseks. Algses simulatsioonis eeldati, et 2% inimestest on radikaalid: nende arvamus ei muutu kunagi (näiteks põhimõtteline lamemaalane, kes kas kosmoreisil maaKERA nähes ei usu, et Maa on ümmargune). Kui radikaale ei ole, toimub polariseerumine suuremate väärtuste juures (alates 9. suhtest ja 4.5 sõbrast). Alljärgnev joonis on selle tõestuseks.\r\n",
    "Polariseerumine ilma 2% radikaalidetaTeiseks võiks ju vähendada sõprade arvu. Kuid sotsiaalmeediat tagasi pöörata ei saa ning metsa erakuks minna tahavad vähesed. Mõttekam oleks mõjutada sotsiaalse stressi tundlikkust ehk seda kui palju sa talud arvamuste erisust oma tutvusringkonnas. Mida väiksem on tundlikkus, seda vähem tekib polariseerumist. Allolevalt jooniselt on seda näha. Sotsiaalse stressi tundlikkus on seal valitud üle kahe korra väiksema väärtusega kui originaalses simulatsioonis (1.0 endise 2.7 asemel).\r\n",
    "Väga selget polariseerumist neilt graafikutelt ei paista. Seega, kui sul on savi, mida sinu sõbrad (või oponendid) poliitikast arvavad, siis on polariseerumise tõenäosus väiksem.\r\n",

Kuid langus endisele tasmele toimub keskmiselt alles 4.0 sõbra juurde jõudes. Ehk polariseerumise vähendamiseks peaks sõpru vähendama alla piiri, millest polariseerumine hakkas kasvama. Peenema nimega on tegu hüstereesiga: tulemus sõltub protsessi suunast (ehk protsessil on mälu).\r\n",
    "Lõpetuseks tasuks meeles pidada, et tegemist on simulatsiooniga, mis näitab üldiseid seoseid. Kui sul on rohkem kui 4 või 5 lähedast sõpra, siis ära hakka neid kukele saatma. Küll aga vaata, kas oled oma seisukohti nende omadega liiga sarnaseks kohandanud ning võtnud oponentide suhtes meelega vastanduvaid seisukohti.\r\n",
    "Järeldused\r\n",
    "Lühidalt võib analüüsist järeldada, et suurendades inimeste seotust, kasvab polariseerumine kui süsteemi muud parameetrid (näiteks võime taluda sotsiaalset stressi) jäävad samaks. Üheks reaalse elu polariseerituse tõusu põhjuseks võib olla sotsiaalmeedia suurem kasutus, mis võimaldab suhteliselt madalate kuludega suurendada suhete arvu (nii sõprade kui ka endast teistsuguste vaadetega inimeste seas). Selle hinnaks on kasvav polariseerumine: muutes oma vaated sõprade omadega sarnasemaks ning proovides poliitilistest vastastest selgelt erinev olla.\r\n",
    "Siin tasub tähele panna, et simulatsioon ei anna täpset vastust põhjuslikkuse kohta (et konkreetselt sotsiaalmeedia põhjustab polariseerumist), vaid näitab ära, üldise trendi, mis langeb kokku sotsiaalmeedia laiema levikuga. Meeles tasub pidada, et simulatsioonis käsitleti poliitilist polariseerumist.\r\n",
    "Eraldi uuringut oleks vaja, selgitamaks, kui täisväärtuslikud on sotsiaalmeedia platvormidel olevad suhted. Küsimus on ajendatud sellest, et kui vaadelda uuringus toodud küsitlusi, kus sõprade arv on aja jooksul eri riikides kasvanud, siis samal ajal on kasvanud ka üksikuna tundvate inimeste arv. Võib olla meile tundub, et meil on rohkem lähedasi sõpru, kuid tunneme ka rohkem üksikuna. Palju küsimusi ja hüpoteese.\r\n",
    "Simulatsiooni disain\r\n",
    "Alljärgnevalt lühidalt simulatsiooni disainist. Meeles tasub pidada, et polariseerumine simuleeriti 9 poliitilise dimensiooni pealt, tagamaks seos Pew küsitlusega.\r\n",
    "Sotsiaalne stress\r\n",
    "Uuringu üheks oluliseks komponendiks on sotsiaalse stressi arvutamine. Sellega mõõdetakse kui palju langevad kokku sinu ja su sõprade arvamused. Valem arvestab ka erisust vaenlastega (kellega sa ei taha sarnane olla, kuid oled seotud, neid võib liigitada ka oponeerivate vaadetega inimesteks). Vaenlase all võib siin mõelda ka poliitiliste vaadete osas oponeerivat inimest. Sotsiaalse stressi arvutamiseks kasutatakse alljärgnevat valemit:\r\n",
    "Sotsiaalse stressi valemkus:\r\n",
    "α näitab kui palju sa tahad olla oma sõpradega sarnane. Kui α on kõrge (nt 0.7–0.8), siis on fookus sellel, et sinu vaated ühtiks sõprade omadega. Madalama α puhul on fookus rohkem sellel, et olla vaenlastest (kelle sarnane sa olla ei taha) erinev. α=0.5 juures on mõlemad sama olulised.\r\n",
    "aᵢⱼ näitab sinu ja sinu sõbra/vaenlase (j) arvamuse sarnasust teemas i. Kui kaks sõpra arvavad teemas i ühte moodi, siis on sotsiaalne stress madal. Kui aga inimese arvamus ühtib vaenlasega, siis on stress kõrge (nende vahel peakski olema erisus).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Lühidalt liidetakse iga teema osas sinu ja sinuga seotud inimeste arvamuste sarnasuse skoor, liidetakse kokku ning sõltuvalt sellest, kas teine inimene on sõber või vaenlane rakendatakse tegurit α või (1-α). Mida erinevam on sinu ja sõprade arvamus, seda suurem on stress ning selle vähendamiseks saad sa oma arvamusi muuta nende omadega sarnasemaks.\r\n",
    "Polariseerumine\r\n",
    "Polariseerumist mõõdetakse suhetest moodustunud gruppide arvamuste variatsiooni mõõtmise abil. Kui grupi moodustavate inimeste arvamused grupi sees on variatiivsed on variatsioon grupi sees kõrge. Kuid üle kõikide gruppide on variatsioon madal (koondub keskmise ümber). Kui aga variatsioon gruppide sees on madal (grupiliikmete vaated on sarnased), on variatsioon (ja polariseerumine) gruppide vahel suur. Tekivad selged piirjooned.\r\n",
    "Tundlikkus arvamuste suhtes\r\n",
    "Üks parameeter, mis tulemusi mõjutab on β. See mõõdab, kui palju me sotsiaalset stressi hindame/talume. Sotsiaalne stress võib olla kõrge, kuid me ei pruugi seda üldse oluliseks pidada. Meil võib olla suva mida meie sõbrad või vaenlased mingitest teemadest arvavad.\r\n",
    "β tuleb mängu uuringu simulatsioonis, kus juhuslikult pakutakse välja muuta inimese seisukohta mingis aspektis, seejärel arvutatakse välja sotsiaalse stressi muutus. Kui sotsiaalne stress väheneb võetakse pakkumine alati vastu. Kuid kui see kasvab, siis mõnel juhul võetakse see ikkagi vastu. Selle tõenäosuse arvutamiseks kasutatakse järgnevat valemit:\r\n",
    "Kus ΔH on sotsiaalse stressi muutus. Kui β on madal, siis seda suurem on tõenäsosus, et inimene muudab oma arvamust, ka siis kui see kasvatab sotsiaalset stressi. Ta on lihtsalt selle osas vähem tundlik.\r\n",
    "Simulatsiooni sammud\r\n",
    "Uuring on tegelikult simulatsioon. Luuakse inimesed (kes on lihtsalt punktid) ning nendevahelised seosed. Seoste loomiseks kasutatakse Poissoni jaotusega väikese maailma võrku. Keeruline nimi, kuid sisu on lihtne:\r\n",
    "Genereeritakse inimestevahelised seosed (uuringus kasutati 100 000 inimest). Seoste loomisel arvestatakse, et suurem tõenäosus on omada seotust naabritega (nendega, kes asuvad lähemal)\r\n",
    "Igale inimesele seoste arvu leidmisel kasutatakse Poissoni jaotust. Poissoni jaotus tagab, et enamikul inimestest on vähe seoseid teistega ning mõnel üksikul on neid suurel hulgal\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Alljärgnevalt on näide 100 inimese võrgustikust, kus igal inimesel on keskmiselt 12 suhet (mida on väga palju):\r\n",
    "Võrdluseks võrgustikuga, kus keskmiselt on igal inimesel ainult 3 suhet/seost:\r\n",
    "Edasi läheb simulatsioon teemade ja iga inimese arvamuse juurde konkreetsest teemast:\r\n",
    "genereeritakse iga teema (uuringus kasutatakse üheksat teemat, et tagada võrreldavus Pew Research survey-ga, mis käsitleb poliitikat) osas igale inimesele juhuslik meelsus: 1 (positiivne) või -1 (negatiivne)\r\n",
    "seejärel hakatakse juhuslikult üksikuid arvamusi muutma ning arvutatakse välja, kui palju muutub sotsiaalne stress sinu ja sinuga seotud inimeste vahel kui sinu arvamust muuta\r\n",
    "kui sotsiaalne stress väheneb, siis muutust arvamuses aktsepteeritakse kui sotsiaalne stress suureneb, siis võidakse muudatust aktsepteerida teatud juhul (vt alapeatükki \"Tundlikkus arvamuste suhtes\")\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Seda protsessi korratakse mitu tuhat korda ning lõpuks on meil näha, kuidas inimeste arvamused on muutunud ning kas on tekkind klastrid.\r\n",
    "Polariseerumise korral on ideoloogilised positsioonid jaotunud erinevatesse gruppidesse (kuna simulatsioonis kasutati seisukoha väljendamiseks 1 või -1 on ka tekkinud kaks klastrit):\r\n",
    "Kui polariseerumist ei teki, on positsioonid jaotunud ühtlaselt keskmise ümber:\r\n",
