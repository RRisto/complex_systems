# Complex Systems for the Public Sector – Full Course Plan

---

## Session 1 – Why Intuition Fails

**Goal:** Break confidence in linear thinking; introduce systems fundamentals

**Topics:**
- Complicated vs complex systems
- Stocks, flows, and delays
- Why prediction and "best practice transfer" fail

**Materials:**
- Whiteboard for live sketching
- Bathtub stock-flow diagram
- Reading: Meadows, *Thinking in Systems*, ch. 1–2

**Simulation:**
- Stock-flow bathtub model (Python/matplotlib or Stella online)
- Students adjust inflow/outflow, observe delays

**Use cases:**
- Public IT: features added → backlog grows
- Healthcare waiting lists despite funding
- Housing incentives → price increases

**Exercise:**
Ask: "What happens if we double funding?"
Draw delays → overshoot → backlash

**Key takeaway:** Systems react on their own timetable

## Session 2 – Feedback Loops

**Goal:** Show how loops drive system behavior, not individual actions

**Topics:**
- Reinforcing loops (growth, inequality, enshittification)
- Balancing loops (resistance, regulation)
- Loop interaction and policy whiplash

**Materials:**
- Causal loop diagram handouts
- Sticky notes for mapping
- Reading: Meadows, ch. 2–3

**Simulation:**
- Loopy (browser tool) or InsightMaker
- Students build and run their own loops

**Use cases:**
- Platform regulation → compliance costs → concentration
- Social benefits → stigma → underuse
- Police presence → reporting → perceived crime

**Exercise:**
Groups map one policy with:
- One reinforcing loop
- One balancing loop

**Key takeaway:** Policies don't act—loops do

## Session 3 – Emergence & Self-Organization

**Goal:** Show macro patterns arise from micro rules without central control

**Topics:**
- Emergence
- Self-organization
- Why blaming individuals fails
- Structure over intent

**Materials:**
- Conway's Game of Life video/simulator
- Reading: Meadows on emergence

**Simulation:**
- Conway's Game of Life (online or NetLogo)
- Schelling's segregation model (NetLogo)

**Use cases:**
- Traffic congestion without accidents
- Informal bureaucratic workarounds
- School segregation without explicit policy

**Exercise:**
Ask: "Who caused this outcome?"
Show Game of Life → no controller

**Key takeaway:** Outcomes are properties of structure, not intent

## Session 4 – Tipping Points, Hysteresis & Irreversibility

**Goal:** Understand sudden transitions and why systems don't bounce back

**Topics:**
- Nonlinear response and bifurcation
- Critical transitions
- Hysteresis (path back ≠ path forward)
- Early warning signals
- Irreversible damage

**Materials:**
- S-curve and hysteresis loop diagrams
- Crisis timeline slides
- Reading: Meadows + crisis case study

**Simulation:**
- Bifurcation diagram tool (Python)
- Lake eutrophication model (NetLogo)
- Interactive threshold explorer

**Use cases:**
- Financial crises
- Long-term unemployment
- Ecosystem collapse
- Trust in institutions

**Exercise:**
Timeline: "When should we have intervened?"
Then: "If we reverse policy, do we undo damage?"

**Key takeaway:** Stability hides fragility. Prevention beats repair

---

## Session 5 – Fat Tails & Power Laws

**Goal:** Show why averages mislead and tail risk dominates

**Topics:**
- Normal vs power-law distributions
- Why power laws are different
- Black swans as structural
- Budget and legitimacy shocks

**Materials:**
- Histogram comparisons
- Real data examples
- Reading: Taleb (conceptual excerpts)

**Simulation:**
- Distribution comparison tool (Python notebook)
- Generate normal vs power-law data, compare outcomes

**Use cases:**
- Disaster costs
- Healthcare super-users
- Tax compliance enforcement

**Exercise:**
"If 1% causes 50% of cost, what does fairness mean?"

**Key takeaway:** Risk lives in the tail, not the mean

---

## Session 6 – Networks, Cascades & Fragility

**Goal:** Reveal hidden dependencies and resilience-efficiency trade-offs

**Topics:**
- Network coupling
- Cascade failures
- Efficiency vs robustness
- Trust as infrastructure

**Materials:**
- Network diagrams
- Supply-chain example
- Reading: High-reliability organizations summary

**Simulation:**
- Network cascade model (NetLogo "Virus on Network" or Python networkx)
- Students remove nodes, watch cascades

**Use cases:**
- Energy grids
- Payment systems
- Public procurement concentration

**Exercise:**
Remove one node: "What breaks?"

**Key takeaway:** Optimization creates hidden dependencies

---

## Session 7 – Path Dependence & Lock-In

**Goal:** Show how history constrains future options

**Topics:**
- Increasing returns
- Institutional inertia
- Standards as frozen accidents
- Reform vs redesign

**Materials:**
- Timeline diagrams
- Legacy system examples
- Reading: Arthur on path dependence

**Simulation:**
- Polya urn model (Python)
- Path dependence demonstration showing lock-in

**Use cases:**
- Legacy IT systems
- Legal frameworks
- Administrative procedures

**Exercise:**
"If we designed this today, would it look the same?"

**Key takeaway:** The past constrains the future

---

## Session 8 – Intervening Without Hubris

**Goal:** Learn where and how to intervene effectively

**Topics:**
- Meadows' leverage points
- Why incentives are weak levers
- Information flows
- Paradigms and goals

**Materials:**
- Leverage point ladder diagram
- Case redesign worksheets
- Reading: Meadows, leverage points essay

**Workshop:**
Students use earlier simulation tools to model their intervention

**Use cases:**
- Transparency reforms
- Behavioral nudges
- Institutional redesign

**Exercise:**
Redesign one failed policy using higher leverage points

**Key takeaway:** Most power lies where we least look

---

## Session 9 – Case Lab

**Goal:** Apply all concepts to real problems students bring

**Students bring:**
- One real system from their work
- One policy problem

**They produce:**
- Feedback loop map
- Risk analysis (tipping points, fat tails)
- Intervention strategy using leverage points

**Tools:**
Students apply multiple simulation approaches from earlier sessions
